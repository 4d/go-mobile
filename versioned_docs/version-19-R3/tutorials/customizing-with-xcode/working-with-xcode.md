4D for iOS generates a native iOS app for you which you can modify and customize with Xcode. Let's take a look at the process!

>If you customize your project on Xcode and rebuild it from the Project Editor All of your modifications will be lost!


We'll use the [contact application](../create-your-first-app) we created. 

Download the Starter project:

<div className="center-button">
<a
  className="button button--primary"
  href="#">

</a>
</div>
