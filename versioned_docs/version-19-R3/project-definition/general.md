## Target OS

Select the mobile OS for which you want to build the app. This setting will define the available mobile editor options. 

- On macOS, you can select **Android**, **iOS**, or **both targets**
- On Windows, you can only select the **Android** target.

## Organization
 
**Name:** Name of your company, or your name.

**Identifier:** Enter your organization’s bundle identifier. This will be used to identify your application. The product name you enter is concatenated to create the "Bundle ID" using reverse domain name service notation (see **ID** below). This bundle ID must be unique to your app.

For example, if your company’s name is "MyCompany" and your app’s name is "MyApp", you could choose "com.MyCompany" as your organization’s bundle identifier and your App bundle ID would be "com.MyCompany.MyApp".

:::note

The Bundle ID name must not contain space or special characters such as "*,%,/". They are automatically filtered and replaced with -.

## Product


**Name:** Your app’s name. As described above, the product name is used to create the "Bundle ID". This Bundle ID must be the same as the Bundle ID you created in your Apple Development account.

**Version:** The version of your app. Add version numbers in ascending, sequential order starting with 1.0.

**ID:** (Bundle ID): This area is automatically generated as a composition of your organization identifier and product name. It is not editable. 

**Copyright:** Your app's copyright. The mobile editor suggests a copyright format but you can create your own.

**Icons:** Master icon that will be used in various locations in you app. You just need to designate your icon and the mobile editor generates all of the required formats for you, in accordance with standard mobile guidelines.

- Use the image menu to select or copy your picture.

Once the icon is selected, the mobile editor automatically creates all required icons for the app. You can access the generated icon formats by selecting **Show the icons folder** in the image menu.

### Main color
