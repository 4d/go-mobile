You can test your app at any moment during the development, thanks to the Simulator located on the BUILD tab of the Project Editor.

Letâ€™s take a closer look at the Build tab options:

* **Build and Run:** Launches the app in the Simulator.

* **iPhone X:** The default Simulator. Clicking here will reveal a dropdown list with all available simulators.

* **Project:** Reveals a dropdown list where you can **open the project folder** or **product folder**, or **open the product with Xcode**. This dropdown list is useful for [debug operations](../debug/from-project-editor). 

* **Install:** Installs the application on a connected device (see [Installing on your iOS device](../deployment/testing-on-your-device)).
