This page gives you access to your app's publishing settings and special mobile features:


![Publishing section](img/publishing.png)


## Production URL

URL of the Web Server on which mobile apps will connect to read and write data, in production context. You can enter any valid address, i.e.:

```
https://my.wesbsite.com
http://my.website.com:9200
www.website.com/mobile
```

During the development phase, you can leave this area empty and set the [Data source](data.md) to **Current data file**.

:::consejo

The user will be able to [change the server url](#modify-remote-url) from the mobile device.

:::



## Web Server Settings

The **Edit...** button opens the **Web** page of the 4D settings dialog box. Use this page to define the following settings to embed in the mobile app:

- **Enable HTTP** option and **HTTP port**.
- **Enable HTTPS** option and **HTTPS port**.

:::nota

If both HTTP and HTTPS are enabled, HTTP is used.

:::

Activating the HTTPS port requires that you installed a valid [TLS certificate](https://developer.4d.com/docs/Admin/tls.html). You can create test certificates with 4D.

These settings are taken into account only if the [production URL](#production-url) is defined. Otherwise, the local IP address is used.

:::nota

The Simulator always works locally (127.0.0.1 or localhost).

:::

## How it looks on a device

### Settings screen

A Settings screen is available from the tab bar. You can also find it from the More tab if necessary (*i.e.*, your app has more than four tables).

The Settings screen allows you to:

* Consult your remote URL and its current state
* Log out (if connected as an Authorized User)

![Login & Settings screen](img/Login-Settings-screen-Publishing-section-4D-for-iOS.png)


### Modify remote url

You can easily update your remote url from iPhone Settings :

* Open your iPhone Settings
* Select the app you want the remote url to be updated
* Switch on the "Reset server address" option

![Reset remote url](img/Reset-remote-url.png)

* Then restart your app to reset the server address
* And finally define the new remote url

## Authentication

A mobile application can require that the user be authenticated or not.

- When authentication is not enabled, mobile users navigate in the application in Guest mode.
- Once authentication is enabled, mobile users are asked to **login** before connecting to the application.

:::info

In any cases, when a mobile user connects to the server, a [user session](session-management) is created.

:::

### Authentication option

To enable authentication, check the **Authentication** option:

![authentication activation](img/authentication.png)

When this option is selected, a Login form will be displayed to the user at startup. A Default login form is automatically selected in the Login Form menu (see below).


### Authentication method


The **Create...**/**Edit...** button opens the [`On Mobile App Authentication`](../4d/on-mobile-app-authentication.md) database method in the 4D method editor. A default template code is provided, allowing all users to log as guests:

```4d
#DECLARE($request : Object)->$response : Object

/*
        $request = Informations provided by mobile application
        $response = Informations returned to mobile application
*/

$response:=New object

// Check user email
If ($request.email=Null)
    // No email means Guest mode - Allow connection
    $response.success:=True
Else 
    // Authenticated mode - Allow or not the connection according to email or other device property
    $response.success:=True
End if 

// Optional message to display on mobile App.
If ($response.success)
    $response.statusText:="You are successfully authenticated"
Else 
    $response.statusText:="Sorry, you are not authorized to use this application."
End if 

```

This method handles all incoming requests from the mobile apps and accepts or denies the connection. See the [On Mobile App Authentication](../4d/on-mobile-app-authentication) database method page for a full description of the method.

The most common and comfortable way to authenticate mobile users is to rely on email authentication. For a detailed example of email-based double authentication, please refer to [this tutorial](../tutorials/login-forms/email.md).

### Login Form

The Login Form menu proposes all login forms available in the project, so that you can select the form to use.  **Default** is a basic login form provided by the mobile editor. Its uses the user email as identifier.

You can also create or download [custom login forms](../tutorials/login-forms/custom-login-form). Once installed, custom login forms are listed in the Login Form pop up. You can either create or download custom login forms. Custom login forms can be downloaded from the [**Login form Github gallery**](https://4d-go-mobile.github.io/gallery//#/type/form-login).

A custom login form is associated to a `manifest.json` file and (optionally) Swift or Kotlin source code. The custom login form files must be stored into a subfolder at the following location:

```
myProject/Resources/Mobile/Form/Login/
```

The `manifest.json` file contains the following attributes:

| Propiedad                   | Type               | Descripci√≥n                                      |
| --------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| "**name**"                  | texto              | login form name                                  |
| "**type**"                  | texto              | set to "login"                                   |
| Optional "**capabilities**" | object             | to add information or options according to needs |
| "**target**"                | text or collection | platform(s) supported by your login form         |
