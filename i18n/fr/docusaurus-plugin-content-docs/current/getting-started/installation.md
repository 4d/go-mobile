To benefit from the integrated **4D go mobile** features in your 4D development environment, you need to download and install the 4D for Mobile component.


## Installing 4D Mobile App

You need to install the **4D Mobile App** component in the project(s) where you want to use it.

1. Download the packaged and compiled 4D-Mobile-App version from [latest release](https://github.com/4d/4D-Mobile-App/releases/latest) on github.
2. Copy the downloaded files in the [Components](https://developer.4d.com/docs/Project/architecture#components) folder of your project.
3. (optional) if necessary, download and install the [**4D Mobile App Server**](https://github.com/4d/4D-Mobile-App-Server#4d-mobile-app-server) component at the same location.
3. Open your project with 4D.

The [4D for Mobile interface](../project-definition/overview.md) is now available in your project.

::: note

Alternatively, you can download and install the source files of the 4D for Mobile component, allowing you to customize the component sources under a standard *Contribution License Agreement*. More information is provided in the [4d-mobile-app README file](https://github.com/4d/4D-Mobile-App#4d-mobile-app).
