You must have a valid Apple Developer account to **distribute an iOS app**. Apple offers two developer programs:

* **[Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/)** **for organization** or **for individual** ($99/year) - Allows you to distribute app(s) **on the App Store**.
* **[Apple Developer Enterprise Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/enterprise/)** ($299/year) - Provides resources ONLY for developing and distributing **proprietary, in-house apps** to employees

For **test purposes** you can use a **Free Apple Developer Program** (*Sign in with Apple ID*, see below).
