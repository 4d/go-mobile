It may happen that you encounter issues using the 4D mobile project editor or your iOS or Android app. Reading log files can provide useful information in these cases.

To access log files, press the **Alt** key and select **Project** from the BUILD panel of the project editor:

Additional debug menu items appear for the [currently selected simulator](../project-definition/build-panel#using-the-simulator):


* **Open Simulator logs**: where you can find the `CrashReporter MobileInstallation` folder

* **Open Simulator Diagnostic Reports**

* **Open Current Simulator Folder**

* **Open Application Simulator Folder**: opens a submenu for each application
