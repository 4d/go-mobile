> Choose the appropriate Apple Developer Program.

You must have a valid Apple Developer account to **distribute an iOS app**. Apple offers two developer programs:

* **Apple Developer Program for organization** or **for individual** – $99/year
* **Apple Enterprise Developer Program** – $299/year

The main difference between the two programs is:

* **Apple Developer Program (for organization or individual)**: Allows you to distribute app(s) **on the App Store**.

* **Apple Developer Enterprise Program**: Provides resources ONLY for developing and distributing **proprietary, in-house apps** to employees.

For **test purposes** you can use a Free Apple Developer Program.

Here is a chart comparing the different levels of developer membership:
