In this tutorial, we'll cover **restricted queries** with a simple use case: imagine you're an account manager and you want to consult your *In Progress* contracts simply by connecting to your app with your email address.

First, from the Data section we're going define a **basic filter query** to only display *In Progress* contracts. Then we're going to apply a **user information-based filter** which will depend on the account manager's email.

## Download the Starter Project

Before we begin, be sure to download the **Starter Project** which includes a **4DforiOSQueries.4dbase** file (a demo database with a ready-to-use mobile app project)

<div markdown="1" style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px">
<a class="button"
href="https://github.com/4d-for-ios/tutorial-RestrictedQueries/releases/latest/download/tutorial-RestrictedQueries.zip">STARTER PROJECT</a>
</div>

The database includes a:

* **CRM table** with all the data we want to display in the generated iOS app
* **AccountManager table** with basic information about the account managers (email and name).
