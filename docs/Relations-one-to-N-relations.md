This tutorial will show you how easy it can be to include One to Many relations in 4D for iOS.


> **NOTE**
>
> In this tutorial, we will use the relation names between your tables.
Giving descriptive relation names can make your project structure definition easier.

Let's get started by downloading the Starter Project:

<div markdown="1" style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px">

</div>

In this tutorial, we are going to build a colorful **Task app** using 4D for iOS.

But first, let's have a look at the structure of our database:

![Select link from structure section](assets/en/relations/Database-1-to-N-relations-4D-for-iOS.png)

As you can see, there is a One to Many link named **tasks** that we will use in our iOS app to display the employees'(**One**) tasks(**to Many**).

Now, go straight to Open menu > Mobile project... to select *Time Keeper* and go to the **Structure section**.

## Structure section

You can see the **tasks relation** we have seen earlier... Publish it !

This will now operate as any other field for the rest of the app creation process.

> **TIPS**
>
> * On mouse over, a tip displays the table name originating the relation.

## Labels & Icons section

The One to Many relation is now available in the [Labels and Icons](labels-and-icons.html) section.

It is important to know that including a One to Many relation will create a button into the genrated iOS app.

So, in the Labels & Icons section you will define:

* a button Label
* a button icon
* a [title](one-to-n-relations-title-definition.html) that will be displayed in the destination view (to indicate where you come from for example).

## Forms section

* Go to the Forms section and drop the *tasks* relation on the Employee Task Detail form.

## Build and Run

1. From the Employee List form, click on one employee 
2. This will open the employee's detail form, where you should see a new **Relation button** !
3. Click on this Relation button to display the employee's tasks.

And voila, this is how One to Many relations work in 4D for iOS !
