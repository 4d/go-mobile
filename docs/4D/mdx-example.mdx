## Making the syntax mdx-compatible

The initial html code for the following examples is located in the define-first-action.md file in 4d for iOS.

For .md files, the following syntax is fine: 

```html
<div markdown="1" style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px"> 

<a class="button"
href="https://github.com/4d-for-ios/tutorial-Actions/releases/latest/download/tutorial-Actions.zip">STARTER PROJECT</a>

</div>
```

With MDX, html tags are supported but you need to use the JSX syntax. So to get the same result, you would write it like this: 


```jsx {1,3}
<div style= {{ textAlign: "center", marginTop: "20px", marginBottom: "20px" }}>

<a className="button"
href="https://github.com/4d-for-ios/tutorial-Actions/archive/cf16581214a8a6e4e4067bcff43ac1265ec43ff7.zip">STARTER PROJECT</a>

</div>
```
Here are the main differences between css and jsx for styling:
- class becomes className
- curly brackets indicate that you're inserting javascript inside html
- use camelCase for property names (text-align becomes textAlign)
- values are strings ("center")

Here's the result :
<div style= {{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", marginTop: "20px", marginBottom: "20px" }}>
<a className="button button--primary" href="https://github.com/4d-for-ios/tutorial-Actions/archive/cf16581214a8a6e4e4067bcff43ac1265ec43ff7.zip">Starter Project</a>
</div>

>Adding a global customized style instead of writing all the css properties here would probably be more efficient.

Here's another example:

*You can download the **Final project** that includes various actions:*

<div style= {{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", marginTop: "20px", marginBottom: "20px" }}>
<a className="button button--primary" href="https://github.com/4d-for-ios/tutorial-Actions/releases/latest/download/tutorial-Actions.zip">Final Project</a>
</div>

## Linking to an asset

You can create links to assets and use them in buttons:

```
<a
  className="button button--primary"
  target="_blank"
  href={require('./assets/contact-app-starter.zip').default}>
  Starter project
</a>
```

This link points to an asset stored in an "asset" folder, located at the same level as the .md file.

Result: 
<a
  className="button button--primary"
  target="_blank"
  href={require('./assets/contact-app-starter.zip').default}>
  Starter project
</a>
