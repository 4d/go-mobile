### Use 17R6 with macOS 10.14.3

4D 17R6 requires Swift5.0 runtime. (already installed with macOS 10.14.4)

 - Install `Swift 5 Runtime Support for Command Line Tools` from [More Downloads for Apple Developers](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/)


### Compatibility

Frameworks compiled with one version of Xcode could not be used with another version.

The current release of swift(5) has ABI stability but no Module Stability. This two condition are needed to ship pre-compiled libraries.

Please see the Swift blog for more details.
