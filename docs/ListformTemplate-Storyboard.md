Now it's time to create your iOS list form interface with Xcode!

Here's the result we want to achieve:

![Storyboard custom listform](assets/en/custom-listform/storyboard-custom-listform.png)

For each cell, we're going to add a:

* Profile image
* Title 
* Subtitle

## Open the storyboard file with Xcode

First, open your storyboard file in Xcode.

![Empty storyboard custom template](assets/en/custom-listform/empty-storyboard-custom-template.png)

It's quite empty, so let's add some content!

## Add an Image View

From the **Object library**, drag and drop an  **Image View** into a cell. You can search for "Image View" in the search bar at the bottom of the Object Library.

![Add Image View storyboard](assets/en/custom-listform/add-imageview-storyboard.png)

From the **Size inspector panel** (on the right side of the Interface Builder window), set the Image View Width value to 110 and the Height value to 110. Then set the X value to 8 and the Y value to 3.

![Image View position height and width](assets/en/custom-listform/imageview-position-height-width.png)

Next, add a constraint (Leading: 8) by clicking on the **Add New Constraints button** (at the bottom of the Interface Builder window). Add width and height constraints too, as shown:

![Image View leading space width height](assets/en/custom-listform/imageview-leading-space-width-height.png)

Finally, click on the **Align button** (at the bottom of the Interface Builder window) and check the "Vertically in Container" checkbox.

![Image View align vertically](assets/en/custom-listform/imageview-align-vertically.png)

Your Image View is now well positioned!

![Image View final](assets/en/custom-listform/imageview-final.png)

Now let's work on the cell's labels.

## Add title and subtitle labels

Let's begin by **adding a View**. Search for "View" in the **Object library** and drag it into the cell container.

![Add View Storyboard](assets/en/custom-listform/add-view-storyboard.png)

From the **Size inspector panel** (on the right side of the Interface Builder window), set the View Width value to 277 and the Height value to 94. Then set the X value to 126 and the Y value to 10.

![View position height and width](assets/en/custom-listform/view-position-height-width.png)

For the Image View, add four constraints by clicking on the **Add New Constraints button** (Trailing: 11, Leading: 8, Top: 11, and Bottom: 10.67) for the view to be well positioned, as shown:

![View contraints Storyboard](assets/en/custom-listform/view-constraints-storyboard.png)

Drag and drop a label into the View you just added from the Object Library.

![Add label Storyboard](assets/en/custom-listform/add-label-storyboard.png)

From the **Size inspector panel**, set the Label View Width value to 269 and the Height value to 32. Then set the X value to 8 and the Y value to 8.

**Duplicate the label** and in the **Size inspector panel**, set the X value to 8 and the Y value to 48.

![Duplicate the label](assets/en/custom-listform/duplicated-label-storyboard.png)

Select both labels add four constraints by clicking on the **Add New Constraints button** (Trailing: 0, Leading: 8, Top: 8, and Bottom: Multiple) as shown:

![Labels contraints storyboard](assets/en/custom-listform/labels-contraints-storyboard.png)

With a label selected, double-click on the **Height constraint** to edit it. 

![Label height constraint edition](assets/en/custom-listform/label-height-constraint-edition.png)

Change the relation from Equal to **Greater Than or Equal** so it can have a variable height (to handle multiline labels). 

![Change relation label height constraint](assets/en/custom-listform/change-relation-label-height-constraint.png)

Repeat the process for the second label.

## Label customization

From the attribute inspector (on the right side of the Interface Builder window),  you can customize your label's font colors. Let's make the second label **Dark Grey Color** :

![Label color dark grey](assets/en/custom-listform/label-color-dark-grey.png)

You can also select the dominant color for your app:

![Label color background color](assets/en/custom-listform/label-color-background-color.png)

From the attribute inspector, you can also customize the font. Select both labels and select Font > Custom > **Helvetica Neue**:

![Label font custom](assets/en/custom-listform/label-font-custom.png)

To complete the customizations, select both labels and **enter 0 for Lines** in the inspector window. This allows the number of lines to be unlimited.

![Label lines number](assets/en/custom-listform/label-lines-number.png)

> **NOTE**
>
> The provided storyboard is optimized to have a **variable cell height** depending on the contents of each cell.

## How to get data into your cells

### Image View
Select your Image View and go to **Identity inspector** > User Defined Runtime Attributes. Click the **+ button** to add a row.

![User defined runtime attributes](assets/en/custom-listform/user-defined-runtime-attributes.png)

* **Key Path**: Begin with bindTo to activate binding on the component. Enter ```bindTo.record.___FIELD_1___```

* **Type**: Always ```String``` 

* **Value**: The attribute name. Enter ```___FIELD_1_BINDING_TYPE___```

![Identity inspector storyboard](assets/en/custom-listform/identity-inspector-storyboard.png)

### Labels

Select the first label and add a row in the Defined Runtime Attributes:

* **Key Path**: ```bindTo.record.___FIELD_2___```

* **Type**: ```String```

* **Value**: ```___FIELD_2_BINDING_TYPE___```

![Field 2 Binding](assets/en/custom-listform/field-2-binding.png)

Select the second label and add a row in the Defined Runtime Attributes:

* **Key Path**: ```bindTo.record.___FIELD_3___```

* **Type**: ```String``` 

* **Value**: ```___FIELD_3_BINDING_TYPE___```

![Field 3 Binding](assets/en/custom-listform/field-3-binding.png)

You can change the **storyboard display labels** to have better visibility: 

* Double-click the first label to edit it and enter ```___FIELD_2_LABEL___```
* Double-click the second label to edit it and enter ```___FIELD_3_LABEL___```

![Storyboard label display names](assets/en/custom-listform/storyboard-label-display-name.png)

Go to your project editor, select your list form template from the Forms section, then select Build and Run.

Here is the simulator result :

## Customize your app

The last step is adding a corner radius to the Image View to have a better design.

Select your Image View and add the two following lines in the User Defined Runtime Attributes:

* **Key Path**: ```cornerRadius```

* **Type**: ```Number``` 

* **Value**: ```12```

and

* **Key Path**: ```layer.masksToBounds```

* **Type**: ```Boolean``` 

* **Value**: Check the box

You can now build your project from the project editor!
