> Choose the appropriate Apple Developer Program.

You must have a valid Apple Developer account to **distribute an iOS app**. Apple offers two developer programs:

* **[Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/)** **for organization** or **for individual** – $99/year 
* **[Apple Enterprise Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/enterprise/)** – $299/year

The main difference between the two programs is:

* **Apple Developer Program (for organization or individual)**: Allows you to distribute app(s) **on the App Store**.

* **Apple Developer Enterprise Program**: Provides resources ONLY for developing and distributing **proprietary, in-house apps** to employees.

For **test purposes** you can use a **Free Apple Developer Program**.

Here is a chart comparing the different levels of developer membership:
