## Prerequisites 



<details><summary style= {{ fontWeight: "bold", marginBottom: "20px" }}>Do I need specific expertise to use 4D for iOS or 4D for Android?</summary>


No. With 4D for iOS and 4D for Android, you can easily create mobile projects directly from 4D, without needing any prior expertise building native iOS or Android apps!

The mobile project editor has been designed so that you don't need any specific knowledge in mobile app developement.
