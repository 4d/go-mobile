## Debug from your Android device

To make sure your development machine and your phone can be linked, a manipulation is necessary on your phone. 

You need to ![enable **USB Debugging**](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#enable) in the Developer Options settings. If you can’t find the Developer Options item in your settings, simply click 7 times on the build number.

If you can’t find it or if you don’t understand it, simply read [this Android user guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options), which explains how to do it depending on the Android versions.

**Note:** If you have a google device, you can do it in Android Studio. You can find the details [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/win-usb).

For the others devices, download and manually install the OEM driver. You can find the details [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/oem-usb).
