* You can choose to let Xcode generate a manifest.plist file for you or generate it manually.

* Click **Next**.

#### What is a manifest?

The manifest is an XML-based property list and should contain:

* **URL** : URL pointing to the .ipa file.
* **display-image**: URL pointing to a 57 x 57 px (72 x 72 px for iPad) PNG icon used during download and installation.
* **full-size-image**: URL pointing to a 512 x 512 px PNG image representing the iTunes app.
* **bundle-identifier**: Your app identifier string. You can get it from your app's .plist file.
* **bundle-version**: Your app's current bundle version string. You can get it from your app's .plist file.
* **title**: Your app's name.

Here is an example of a manifest.plist file :

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">

				<string>Contact Demo app</string>
			</dict>
		</dict>
	</array>
</dict>
</plist>
```


## STEP 9. Distribution manifest information

* We recommand letting Xcode do the job of entering your app URL as well as the icons URLs. You will, of course, have the option to change those URLs later.

* Click **Next**.


## STEP 10. Re-sign your application

* Let Xcode manage the **Automatically manage signing** option.

![Re-sign your application](assets/en/deploy-in-house/Re-sign-your-application.png)

* Click **Next**.

## STEP 11. Review your app.ipa content

* Here you can verify that your application identifier is correct as well as your Team ID.

* Click on **Export** and select where to save your app folder on your computer.
