## STEP 1. Create an App ID

#### What is an App ID ?

*An App ID is a two-part string used to identify one or more apps from a single development team. The string consists of a Team ID and a Bundle ID, with a period (.) separating the two parts (ex: TeamID.BundleID).*

> **NOTE**
> 
> * If you have chosen an Apple Developer Account as an individual, your account is available immediately and you can create your App ID.
> * If you have chosen an Apple Developer Account as an organization, you must wait for Apple validation to create your App ID.

* Click the + sign next to *Register iOS App IDs* to add a new App ID.
