Now let's filter our app content depending on the account manager's login email address (user information):

* Go to the **Data section**. 
* Right-click in the **Filter query** field to make **Field, Comparators and Operators buttons** appear.
* Click on the **Operators** button and select **AND**.
* Now define the user information you want to get from the database method, **:email**.
* Remember to validate the query by clicking on the **Validate** button. If not, you won't be able to build your app.

```4d
Status = 'In Progress' & manager.Email = :email 
```

The query will filter data depending on the **In Progress** status AND the **Account manager's email address** (accessible from the AccountManager table thanks to the *Many-to-One* relation on the manager's name).

> **NOTE**
>
>* A **user icon** is displayed on the right of each table when a user information filter is applied to it.
>* As soon as a query is based on user information and validated, you need to edit the **Mobile app authentication method**. To do so, right-click on the **Edit authentication method** button to open the database method edition window.

Add the following line in the database method:

```4d
$response.userInfo:=New object("email";$request.email)
```

This will allow retrieving the manager's login email address and displaying data depending on that criteria.

Now if you build your app and enter "michelle.simpson@mail.com" as login email, you'll find all of Michelle Simpson's *"In progress"* contracts.
