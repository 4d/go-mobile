> Upload your app to a secured server.


## STEP 1. Upload your app

Upload your app files to a secured server:

* assets (display-image and full-size-image)
* manifest.plist file
* .ipa file

You can use any cloud storage service to distribute your app as soon as it is secured (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.).

> **NOTE**
>
> Your asset and ipa URLs must match the URLs defined in your manifest.plist file.

## STEP 2. Create the installation link

Create an **ITMS Serices link** (iTUnes Music Store) with the full web address of your manifest file as a parameter:

```
itms-services://?action=download-manifest&url=https://mywebserver.com/manifest.plist

```

This link can be used when sending emails, embedded in an html page, or even within a QR code.

Here is a simple example:

![Contact demo app install](assets/en/deploy-in-house/Contact-demo-app-install.png)

*The QR Code used for this documentation is not active.*

## STEP 3. Install your enterprise app on iOS

* Install the app by clicking on the link or scanning a QR Code

![Scan and install](assets/en/deploy-in-house/Scan-and-install.png)

* When you first open an enterprise app that you've manually installed, a notification will be displayed stating that the developer of the app isn't trusted on your device. 

* Ignore this message and click **Cancel**.

* In Settings > General > Profiles or Profiles & Device Management, in the "Enterprise App" heading, the profile for the developer is listed.

![Untrust developer](assets/en/deploy-in-house/Untrust-developer.png)

* Tap the name of the developer profile to establish trust for this developer.

![Trust-confirmation](assets/en/deploy-in-house/Trust-confirmation.png)

* You can then go to your app and open it.

Congratulations ... you can now distribute your first app in-house!
