This is where you'll define properties for your tables, fields and relations:

* **Short and long labels:** used according to the available space in the template (to optimize space and avoid overcrowding the tab bar).
* **Icons:** 4D for iOS provides a large library of embedded icons to meet your needs. These include icons for business, finance, education, government, health, industry, real estate, services, etc.

* **Formats:** used to control how the values of the fields are displayed (currencies, percents...)

* **Title:** used to display a title in the destination view using relations

![Labels & Icons section Fields properties](assets/en/project-editor/Fields-properties-Labels-icons-section-4D-for-iOS.png)

For fields, you will be able to define the following properties:

* **Short and Long labels:** used depending on space
* **Icons**
* **Formats:** for exemple to display currencies or percentage

Those elements will be displayed in detail and list forms, depending on the template in the generated app.

> **TIPS**
>
> * To keep everything consistent, **default icons** are generated for blank fields if at least one icon has been defined for a field. 
>
> * You can also leave the icon area empty if you donâ€™t want to display icons in your application.

## Relations properties

* **Short and Long labels:** displayed in the Relation button that allows to open a related table
* **Icons:** displayed at the left of the Relation button
* **Title:** that will be displayed on top of the destination view when using a relation. A [tutorial](one-to-many-relations-title-definition.html) is available to guide you through the Title definition process
